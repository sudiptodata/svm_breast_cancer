# Support Vector Machine for Breast Cancer Classification

A machine learning model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process. It is created by training an algorithm on a dataset that consists of input data and corresponding correct output. One type of machine learning model is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Its primary objective is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between them. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are suitable for both linear and nonlinear data through the use of kernel functions. By selecting support vectors, SVMs are robust to overfitting and generalize well with small datasets. This versatility makes them widely used in fields like image recognition, bioinformatics, and text classification.

## The Dataset: Scikit-learn Breast Cancer

The Scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used in machine learning for binary classification tasks. It comprises features computed from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies and aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. With 30 features, including texture, perimeter, and smoothness, the dataset provides a rich source of information for model training and evaluation. This dataset is invaluable for testing the performance of classification algorithms, enabling researchers to develop accurate models for breast cancer diagnosis. Its availability within Scikit-learn facilitates easy access and integration into machine learning workflows. The dataset can be imported from Scikit-learn's `datasets` module using `datasets.load_breast_cancer()`.

- Symmetry error
- Fractal dimension error
- Worst radius
- Worst texture
- Worst perimeter
- Worst area
- Worst smoothness
- Worst compactness
- Worst concavity
- Worst concave points
- Worst symmetry
- Worst fractal dimension

The target variable or label in the dataset contains two values: 'malignant' and 'benign'. The shape of the dataset is 569 samples with 30 features.

## Model Building

To build the model, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. The dataset is divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. 

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

- Shape of X_train: (398, 30)
- Shape of y_train: (398,)
- Shape of X_test: (171, 30)
- Shape of y_test: (171,)

The support vector machine model in Scikit-learn can be implemented as follows:

```python
from sklearn import svm

model = svm.SVC(kernel="linear")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

After training the model, predictions are made on the test data. Model performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Model Evaluation

The classification report provides a detailed summary of the model's performance on the Scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset:

  - For class 0 (malignant tumors), precision is 0.94, indicating that 94% of instances classified as malignant were correctly classified.
  - For class 1 (benign tumors), precision is 0.96, showing that 96% of instances classified as benign were correctly classified.

- **Recall**:
  - For class 0, recall is 0.94, indicating that 94% of actual malignant instances were correctly classified.
  - For class 1, recall is 0.96, indicating that 96% of actual benign instances were correctly classified.

- **F1-score**:
  - For class 0, the F1-score is 0.94, representing the harmonic mean of precision and recall for malignant tumors.
  - For class 1, the F1-score is 0.96, representing the harmonic mean of precision and recall for benign tumors.

- **Support**:
  - There are 62 instances of malignant tumors and 109 instances of benign tumors in the dataset.

- **Accuracy**:
  - Overall accuracy is 0.95, indicating that 95% of all instances were correctly classified.

The macro average and weighted average provide summary statistics across classes, with both averaging at 0.95 for precision, recall, and F1-score. This report offers comprehensive insights into the model's performance, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately classifying breast cancer tumors.
